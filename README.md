# SCSM-v11.2-QuantumGravityConsciousness
A fully formalized speculative physics framework unifying consciousness phenomenology with algebraic quantum gravity and information geometry. SCSM v11.2 models persistent identities as topological invariants in Planck‑scale gauge foam, bridged to biological coherence through a quantized χ‑field mediator.
